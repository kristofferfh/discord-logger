You might encounter some issues while trying to run this application, below are a few of the issues I've encountered with this project.

### Path issues with cli on windows
If you're getting the error ``The term '...' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet`` when trying to use cli command names, check your system enviromentals path settings. This can be done trough opening system properties > Environment Variables then clicking path and selecting edit.
You can then add paths for the executables you need.
